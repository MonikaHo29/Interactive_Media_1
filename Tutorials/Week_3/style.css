/* ERRORS & DEBUGGING ======================= */
/* SYNTAX = Misspelled code or missing elements in syntax, e.g missing semicolon, missing closing bracket, etc., can cause the code to not work.
/* SEMANTICS = Code or structure that just doesn't make sense (to others).
/* STYLING = When styles donâ€™t apply as expected.
/* SELECTION = Failing to select elements to apply styles.
/* CASCADING = Unintentionally having styles overriding others. 
/* LINKING = Missing connection between HTML and CSS (and later, JS), misspelled linking, giving file wrong name, etc.
*/

/* TIPS ======================= */
/* 1. Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the code and see what's happening.
    --> INSPECTOR = Check the HTML structure and CSS styles. Change the styles in the browser to see what happens. Didn't influence the code in VS. = developer tools, VERY HELPFUL!
/* 2. Use the browser's console to see if there are any errors.
