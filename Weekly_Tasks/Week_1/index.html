        <h1>Workers Just Started Building the World’s First 3D-Printed Hotel in the Texas Desert</h1>
        <h2>In the dusty landscape surrounding the city of Marfa, a huge 3D printer is constructing 43 new rooms and 18
            residential homes as part of an expansion of El Cosmico.</h2>

        <h4>A rendering of the 3D-printed rounded hotel rooms</h4>
        <p> Everything’s bigger in Texas, where even 3D printers take on cosmic proportions. The <strong>Lone Star State</strong>
            will soon be the site of the world’s first 3D-printed hotel, <a href="https://elcosmico.com/">El Cosmico</a>, which has 
            just begun construction in the desert north of Marfa.
        </p>
        <p> Passersby won’t see the cranes and scaffolding that typically come with construction. Photos of the site show
            a massive 46.5-foot-wide and 15.5-foot-tall 3D printer laying layer upon layer of sand-colored material onto
            the foundations, creating curvy sand-colored walls. This behemoth of a machine, called <strong>the Vulcan</strong>, 
            was created by <strong>Texas-based 3D printing and robotics company ICON.</strong>
        </p>
        <p> When the Vulcan constructs walls, it looks “like an inkjet printer with a cartridge going back and forth,”
            Liz Lambert, El Cosmico’s owner, tells the <a href="https://bigbendsentinel.com/2024/07/31/el-cosmico-2-0-breaks-ground-with-model-home-hotel-room/">
            Big Bend Sentinel’s</a> Mary Cantrell.

        <h4>Workers recently broke ground on the new El Cosmico north of Marfa, Texas</h4>
        <p> The project is a collaboration between <strong>Lambert, ICON</strong> and <strong>architects at Bjarke Ingels
            Group</strong>. Lambert seeks to expand the existing El Cosmico hotel, adding 43 new units and 18
            residential homes on a new 40-acre property. According to a statement from ICON, 3D printing will allow for
            domes, arches, vaults and new versatility in architectural approaches.
        </p>
        <p> “I’ve never been able to build with such little constraint and such fluidity ... just the curves, and the
            domes, and the parabolas,” Lambert tells <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/worlds-first-3d-printed-hotel-takes-shape-texas-2024-09-26/">Reuters’</a>
            Evan Garcia. “It’s a crazy way to build.”

            images</a> of the hotel’s interior show cream curvilinear walls and rounded wooden surfaces full of
            colors that reflect the surrounding desert. In addition to the hotel, El Cosmico will include several
            3D-printed homes, which are currently priced for <strong>upwards of $2.29 million</strong>. Reuters reports
            that the hotel units will cost between $200 and $450 per night.
